# Changelog

## [1.1.8](https://github.com/trpc-group/trpc-agent-python/releases/tag/v1.1.8) (2026-06-12)

### Features

* Session: Reworked session history storage from `Event.model_flags`-based model visibility to an active/historical split, with `Session.events` holding the active model window and `Session.historical_events` optionally retaining events moved out by max-event filtering, TTL, or summarization.
* Session: Added `SessionServiceConfig.store_historical_events`, updated Redis, SQL, and InMemory persistence semantics for active/historical events, and kept list APIs lightweight by omitting both active and historical events from `list_sessions()`.
* Session: Optimized summarization by keeping `[summary_event, recent_events...]` as the new active window and checking only the leading summary anchor instead of repeatedly scanning the event list.
* Model: Added configuration support for OpenAI/Anthropic APIs and LiteLLM prompt cache.

### Bug Fixes

* Telemetry: Propagated span context correctly in async generators by using `start_span` with context attach/detach, and fixed member-agent input tracing to prefer `override_messages` over `user_content`.

## [1.1.7](https://github.com/trpc-group/trpc-agent-python/releases/tag/v1.1.7) (2026-06-05)

### Bug Fixes

* Runner: Added `close_session_service_on_close` and `close_memory_service_on_close` controls so short-lived runners can skip closing externally managed session and memory services, such as shared Redis-backed services.
* MCP: Updated Streamable HTTP session creation to prefer the non-deprecated `streamable_http_client` API, with fallback support for older MCP SDKs that only expose `streamablehttp_client`.
* MCP: Moved Streamable HTTP headers and timeout configuration onto an owned `httpx.AsyncClient`, avoiding deprecated transport arguments while keeping the HTTP client lifecycle tied to the MCP session context.
* Storage: Fixed frequent sqlite warnings in `SqlSessionService` by consistently using database-side `func.now()` for update timestamps.


## [1.1.6](https://github.com/trpc-group/trpc-agent-python/releases/tag/v1.1.6) (2026-06-03)

### Features

* Skill: Added a recoverable Cube sandbox runtime for skills, including `CubeClientConfig`, a unified `create_cube_sandbox_client` entry point, optional `auto_recover` support in `CubeSandboxClient`, sandbox lifecycle helpers, and direct `CubeWorkspaceRuntime` creation from the client.
* Skill: Unified skill load/run/exec/stager paths around repository-level workspace runtime resolution via `repository.get_workspace_runtime(ctx)`, so tools under the same skill repository share one workspace runtime context.
* MCP: Added MCP tool caching to avoid repeated network access.
* Tools: Added `GraphAgent` support in `AgentTool`, allowing wrapped graph agents to return results from tool context state.
* Examples/Eval: Restored evaluation examples that were previously removed during open-source cleanup.
* Optimizer: Added support for the prompt self-optimization `AgentOptimizer`.

### Bug Fixes

* Storage: Fixed frequent sqlite warnings in `SqlSessionService` by consistently using database-side `func.now()` for update timestamps.

## [1.1.5](https://github.com/trpc-group/trpc-agent-python/releases/tag/v1.1.5) (2026-05-19)

### Features

* Tools: Added `StreamingProgressTool` with matching `ToolsProcessor` plumbing so tools can surface intermediate progress as `partial=True` events while still emitting a single final `function_response`; included `BaseTool` streaming hooks, the `llmagent_with_streaming_progress_tool` example and verification script.
* Eval: Added `RemoteEvalService` to drive evaluations against agents exposed over remote interfaces, refactored `AgentEvaluator` to support remote agent calls, and expanded English/Chinese evaluation docs.
* Model: Landed the OpenAI-compatible adapter layer (`models/openai_adapter/{_base,_deepseek,_hunyuan}.py`) that isolates provider-specific behavior from `OpenAIModel`, including DeepSeek v4 thinking / `response_format` / `reasoning_content` / token usage handling and hy3-preview ToolPrompt text parsing with streaming filter.
* Examples: Added `examples/mempalace_mcp` (MemPalace via MCP) and updated `examples/llmagent_with_thinking` to enable `add_tools_to_prompt` only for hy3-preview and display thinking / tool calls / final answer separately.

* Utils: Added `json_loads_repair` and `json_repair_string` helpers (backed by `json_repair`) under `trpc_agent_sdk.utils`, with full unit test coverage.
* Model/Tools: Adopted `json_repair` only on JSON-tolerant paths — `JsonToolPrompt` / `XmlToolPrompt` parse_function, non-streaming OpenAI tool-call args, `AgentTool` structured-output validation, skills tool result parsing — while keeping strict `json.loads` for the streaming tool-call accumulator (to preserve "wait for next chunk" semantics) and Hunyuan plain-text `<arg_value>` parsing (to avoid silently coercing plain text into empty strings).
* Model: Fixed ToolPrompt streaming parsing so multiple tool calls in a single response are all preserved instead of only the last one being kept.

### Bug Fixes

* Teams: TeamAgent now honors `actions.skip_summarization` from custom tool events, so tools like `AgentTool(skip_summarization=True)` and `StreamingProgressTool(skip_summarization=True)` end the leader loop without an extra summarization turn (previously masked by leader's `disable_react_tool=True`).

## [1.1.4](https://github.com/trpc-group/trpc-agent-python/releases/tag/v1.1.4) (2026-05-13)

### Bug Fixes

* Tools: Removed default `mempalace_tool` exports from `trpc_agent_sdk.tools` to avoid forcing MemPalace optional dependencies during base package import.

## [1.1.3](https://github.com/trpc-group/trpc-agent-python/releases/tag/v1.1.3) (2026-05-12)

### Features

* Model: Added an OpenAI-compatible adapter layer to isolate provider-specific behaviors, including DeepSeek v4 reasoning/format handling and hy3-preview tool-prompt parsing support.
* Memory: Added MemPalace integration with `MemPalaceMemoryService` and `mempalace_tool`, plus related examples and documentation.
* Code Execution: Added Cube/E2B sandbox executor and workspace runtime with optional dependency support and end-to-end example coverage.
* Eval: Added support for evaluating the same metric across different LLMs.

### Bug Fixes

* Model: Fixed ToolPrompt streaming parsing so multiple tool calls in one response are preserved instead of only the last call.
* Storage: Improved SQL storage compatibility by filtering empty content parts, fixing MySQL `DynamicPickleType` serialization, and stabilizing session timestamp updates.
* Eval: Fixed judge-agent JSON output handling in the eval module.
* CI: Added missing `e2b-code-interpreter` test dependency to prevent cube test collection failures.

## [1.1.2.post1](https://github.com/trpc-group/trpc-agent-python/releases/tag/v1.1.2.post1) (2026-04-29)

### Features

* Session: Updated session summarization to retain full conversation history while marking summarized events as model-invisible.
* Session: Added backend-threaded summarization execution to avoid blocking front-end conversation turns.
* Skill: Added multi-user support for skill operations.

### Bug Fixes

* Code Execution: Fixed the conflict between code execution and tool invocation where tool data could be lost after code execution.
* MCP: Added support for parsing and returning multiple MCP tool results in a single response.

## [1.1.2](https://github.com/trpc-group/trpc-agent-python/releases/tag/v1.1.2) (2026-04-24)

### Features

* Telemetry: Added OpenTelemetry metrics reporting and introduced `custom_metrics` to support framework metric reporting when parsing remote agent responses.
* Tools: Added `web_search` with DuckDuckGo and Google providers, and added `web_fetch` for webpage content retrieval.
* Docs/Examples: Added usage documentation and examples for `web_search` and `web_fetch`.

### Bug Fixes

* Teams: Fixed parallel delegation signal loss and enabled streaming output in team delegation flows.

## [1.1.1](https://github.com/trpc-group/trpc-agent-python/releases/tag/v1.1.1) (2026-04-20)

### Features

* Storage: Added the `usage_metadata` field to SQL storage and introduced automatic migration for missing columns.
* Skill: Added cross-session skill state persistence so loaded skills can be reused across sessions, reducing repeated skill loading and unnecessary retry turns.
* Skill: Added skill install/uninstall awareness so the model can detect skill lifecycle changes and avoid missing-skill lookups or calls to uninstalled skills.
* Session: Added `usage_metadata` support in SQL session storage for persisting and reading token usage statistics.

### Bug Fixes

* Skill: Reduced hallucinated skill command generation when users intend to run commands, lowering invalid command attempts and retry loops.
